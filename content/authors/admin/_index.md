I am a highly motivated student pursuing double majors in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and Data Science. My research interests include stochastic analysis, optimization, and machine learning with applications in finance and dynamic systems. I am also interested in interdisciplinary areas where applied probability, statistics, and control theory intersect to solve practical problems in complex, real-world settings.
